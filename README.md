# Still Watching? — A Micro-Intervention UX Concept for YouTube

This project explores a user-centered design solution aimed at improving content consumption awareness on YouTube without interrupting the user experience or compromising platform engagement.

## Overview

Many YouTube users—especially children and young adults—begin their sessions with clear intent, but often drift into extended, passive watching through autoplay and algorithmic suggestions. Existing tools like "Take a Break" reminders are valuable, but often go unnoticed during immersive usage.

This project proposes design solutions to gently surface awareness mid-session and offer a moment of user reflection and control—without friction.



## Tools Used

- **Figma** – UI/UX design and prototyping  
- **Design Thinking (5D)** – Discover, Define, Dream, Design, Develop  
- **User Personas,empathy maps,Research paper analysis,Primary and  secondary research and in depth interviews** – Based on real behavioral patterns

## Why This Matters

This solution adds clarity and intention back into the user journey—especially for young or emotionally passive viewers—while respecting YouTube’s platform goals of seamless engagement and content discovery.

## Screens & Prototype

This projects explores three conceptual design solutions to address compulsive binge-watching behavior within YouTube:

### 🧠 1. Cognitive Mirror (Time-Emotion Feedback)
A friendly pop-up or overlay that appears after a set duration (e.g., 45 minutes), offering a reflective prompt like:  
> “You’ve been watching for a while. How are you feeling?”  
This helps users reconnect with their intent in real-time.

---

### 🎬 2. Narrative Disruption (Intentional Flow Break)
Instead of endless similar recommendations, this approach introduces an intentional pacing shift—offering slower or calmer content at natural transition points to simulate the user’s mental “pause moment.”  
It gently mimics a stop point, without forcing one.

---

### 🌫️ 3. Shadow-Tracking UI (Passive Awareness Cues)
This subtle design cue reduces screen saturation or slightly blurs visuals as the session continues, serving as a **non-verbal reminder** that the user has been watching for a while.  
It encourages self-regulation without interrupting the experience.

---

Each solution focuses on **in-flow awareness**, helping users make conscious choices—**without reducing engagement or retention**.
